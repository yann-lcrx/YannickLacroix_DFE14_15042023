### Commit Message Convention

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#summary). Each commit message must be formatted with the following convention:

```
<type>([optional scope]): <commit description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Following this convention allows us to speak the same language, but also to start automating the redaction of changelogs down the road.

**Make sure to read and understand the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#summary)** and contact the repository maintainers when in doubt.
